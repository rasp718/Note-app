+that didnt seem to work. the purpose of this is so that when the user changes the section to write the note in he knows what section that is because it says it on the top in the flfloating center pill header. maybe we try it again? the logo that is in the pil should be in another circle pill centered left in the center pill. My Notes in white letter and below it the category section of the notes. when you switch sections the text in the center pill switches to correspond with it.
